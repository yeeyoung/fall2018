Machine learning
Machine learning is a field of computer science that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to "learn" (e.g.,
progressively improve performance on a specific task) withdata, without being explicitly programmed.[2]
The name machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel.[1] Evolved from the study of pattern recognition and
computational learning theoryin artificial intelligence,[3] machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can
learn from and make predictions ondata[4] – such algorithms overcome following strictly static program instructions by making datadriven predictions or decisions,[5]:2 through building a model from sample inputs. Machine learning is employed in a range of
computing tasks where designing and programming explicit algorithms with good performance is difficult or infeasible; example
applications include email filtering, detection of network intruders, andcomputer vision.
Machine learning is closely related to (and often overlaps with) computational statistics, which also focuses on prediction-making
through the use of computers. It has strong ties to mathematical optimization, which delivers methods, theory and application
domains to the field. Machine learning is sometimes conflated with data mining,[6] where the latter subfield focuses more on
exploratory data analysisand is known as unsupervised learning.[7][8]
Within the field of data analytics, machine learning is a method used to devise complex models and algorithms that lend themselves
to prediction; in commercial use, this is known as predictive analytics. These analytical models allow researchers, data scientists,
engineers, and analysts to "produce reliable, repeatable decisions and results" and uncover "hidden insights" through learning from
historical relationships and trends in the data.[9]

Overview
Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: "A
computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its
performance at tasks inT, as measured by P, improves with experience E."[10] This definition of the tasks in which machine learning
is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This followsAlan Turing's
proposal in his paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence", in which the question "Can machines think?" is replaced with the
question "Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?".[11] In Turing's proposal the various characteristics that could be
possessed by a thinking machine and the various implications in constructing one are exposed.

Machine learning tasks
Machine learning tasks are typically classified into two broad categories, depending on whether there is a learning "signal" or
"feedback" available to a learning system:
Supervised learning: The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a "teacher",
and the goal is to learn a general rule thatmaps inputs to outputs. As special cases, the input signal can be only
partially available, or restricted to special feedback:
Semi-supervised learning: the computer is given only an incomplete training signal: a training set with some
(often many) of the target outputs missing.
Active learning: the computer can only obtain training labels for a limited set of instances (based on a budget),
and also has to optimize its choice of objects to acquire labels for
. When used interactively, these can be
presented to the user for labeling.
Reinforcement learning: training data (in form of rewards and punishments) is given only as feedback to the
program's actions in a dynamic environment, such asdriving a vehicle or playing a game against an
opponent.[5]:3
Unsupervised learning: No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input.
Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end
(feature learning).

Machine learning applications
Another categorization of machine learning tasks arises when one considers the desired
output of a machine-learned system:[5]:3
In classification, inputs are divided into two or more classes, and the learner must produce a model that assigns
unseen inputs to one or more m
( ulti-label classification) of these classes. This is typically tackled in a supervised
way. Spam filtering is an example of classification, where the inputs are email (or other) messages and the classes
are "spam" and "not spam".
In regression, also a supervised problem, the outputs are continuous rather than discrete.

In clustering, a set of inputs is to be divided into groups. Unlike in
classification, the groups are not known beforehand, making this
typically an unsupervised task.
Density estimation finds the distribution of inputs in some space.
Dimensionality reductionsimplifies inputs by mapping them into a lowerdimensional space. Topic modeling is a related problem, where a
program is given a list ofhuman language documents and is tasked to
find out which documents cover similar topics.
Among other categories of machine learning problems, learning to learn learns its
own inductive bias based on previous experience. Developmental learning,
elaborated for robot learning, generates its own sequences (also called curriculum)
of learning situations to cumulatively acquire repertoires of novel skills through
autonomous self-exploration and social interaction with human teachers and using
guidance mechanisms such as active learning, maturation, motor synergies, and
imitation.

History and relationships to other fields

A support vector machineis a
classifier that divides its input space
into two regions, separated by a
linear boundary. Here, it has learned
to distinguish black and white circles.

Arthur Samuel, an American pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial
intelligence, coined the term "Machine Learning" in 1959 while at IBM[12] . As a
scientific endeavour, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence. Already in the early days of AI as an academic
discipline, some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. They attempted to approach the problem with
various symbolic methods, as well as what were then termed "neural networks"; these were mostly perceptrons and other models that
were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics.[13] Probabilistic reasoning was also employed,
especially in automated medical diagnosis.[14]:488
However, an increasing emphasis on the logical, knowledge-based approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning.
Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation.[14]:488 By 1980,
expert systems had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favor.[15] Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did
continue within AI, leading to inductive logic programming, but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI
proper, in pattern recognition and information retrieval.[14]:708–710;

755

Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and

computer science around the same time. This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as "connectionism", by researchers
from other disciplines including Hopfield, Rumelhart and Hinton. Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of
backpropagation.[14]:25
Machine learning, reorganized as a separate field, started to flourish in the 1990s. The field changed its goal from achieving artificial
intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature. It shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited
from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics and probability theory.[15] It also benefited from the increasing
availability of digitized information, and the ability to distribute it via theInternet.
Machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on
prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on the discovery of (previously) unknown
properties in the data (this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases). Data mining uses many machine learning
methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as "unsupervised learning"
or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do
often have separate conferences and separate journals, ECML PKDD being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions
they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge,
while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge. Evaluated
with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods,
while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data.

Machine learning also has intimate ties to optimization: many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss
function on a training set of examples. Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and
the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to
correctly predict the pre-assigned labels of a set of examples). The difference between the two fields arises from the goal of
generalization: while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set, machine learning is concerned with minimizing
the loss on unseen samples.[16]

Relation to statistics
Machine learning and statistics are closely related fields. According to Michael I. Jordan, the ideas of machine learning, from
methodological principles to theoretical tools, have had a long pre-history in statistics.[17] He also suggested the term data science as
a placeholder to call the overall field.[17]
Leo Breiman distinguished two statistical modelling paradigms: data model and algorithmic model,[18] wherein "algorithmic model"
means more or less the machine learning algorithms likeRandom forest.
Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call
statistical learning.[19]

Theory
A core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience.[5][20] Generalization in this context is the ability of a learning
machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set. The training examples
come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner
has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce suf
ficiently accurate predictions in new cases.
The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known
as computational learning theory. Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield
guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. The bias–variance
decomposition is one way to quantify generalizationerror.
For the best performance in the context of generalization, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the
function underlying the data. If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has underfit the data. If the
complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the
model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer.[21]
In addition to performance bounds, computational learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In
computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time. There are two kinds of time
complexity results. Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time. Negative results show
that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time.

Approaches
Decision tree learning
Decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model, which maps observations about an item to conclusions about the
item's target value.

Association rule learning
Association rule learning is a method for discovering interesting relations between variables in lar
ge databases.

Artificial neural networks
An artificial neural network (ANN) learning algorithm, usually called "neural network" (NN), is a learning algorithm that is vaguely
inspired by biological neural networks. Computations are structured in terms of an interconnected group of artificial neurons,
processing information using a connectionist approach to computation. Modern neural networks are non-linear statistical data
modeling tools. They are usually used to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs, to find patterns in data, or to
capture the statistical structure in an unknownjoint probability distributionbetween observed variables.

Deep learning
Falling hardware prices and the development of GPUs for personal use in the last few years have contributed to the development of
the concept of deep learning which consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. This approach tries to model the
way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. Some successful applications of deep learning are computer
vision and speech recognition.[22]

Inductive logic programming
Inductive logic programming (ILP) is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input
examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses. Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples
represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no
negative examples. Inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming languages for representing
hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such asfunctional programs.

Support vector machines
Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression. Given a set
of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts
whether a new example falls into one category or the other
.

Clustering
Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters) so that observations within the same cluster
are similar according to some predesignated criterion or criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar.
Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some similarity metric and
evaluated for example by internal compactness (similarity between members of the same cluster) and separation between different
clusters. Other methods are based onestimated density and graph connectivity. Clustering is a method ofunsupervised learning, and a
common technique forstatistical data analysis.

Bayesian networks
A Bayesian network, belief network or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of
random variables and their conditional independenciesvia a directed acyclic graph (DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could
represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the
probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Ef
ficient algorithms exist that performinference and learning.

Reinforcement learning
Reinforcement learning is concerned with how an agent ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of
long-term reward. Reinforcement learning algorithms attempt to find a policy that maps states of the world to the actions the agent
ought to take in those states. Reinforcement learning differs from the supervised learning problem in that correct input/output pairs
are never presented, nor sub-optimal actions explicitly corrected.

Representation learning
Several learning algorithms, mostly unsupervised learning algorithms, aim at discovering better representations of the inputs
provided during training. Classical examples include principal components analysis and cluster analysis. Representation learning
algorithms often attempt to preserve the information in their input but transform it in a way that makes it useful, often as a preprocessing step before performing classification or predictions, allowing reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data
generating distribution, while not being necessarily faithful for configurations that are implausible under that distribution.
Manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low-dimensional. Sparse coding
algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse (has many zeros). Multilinear subspace
learning algorithms aim to learn low-dimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data,
without reshaping them into (high-dimensional) vectors.[23] Deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation, or a
hierarchy of features, with higher-level, more abstract features defined in terms of (or generating) lower-level features. It has been
argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain
the observed data.[24]

Similarity and metric learning
In this problem, the learning machine is given pairs of examples that are considered similar and pairs of less similar objects. It then
needs to learn a similarity function (or a distance metric function) that can predict if new objects are similar. It is sometimes used in
Recommendation systems.

Sparse dictionary learning
In this method, a datum is represented as a linear combination of basis functions, and the coefficients are assumed to be sparse. Let x
be a d-dimensional datum, D be a d by n matrix, where each column of D represents a basis function. r is the coefficient to represent
x using D. Mathematically, sparse dictionary learning means solving

where r is sparse. Generally speaking, n is assumed to

be larger than d to allow the freedom for a sparse representation.
Learning a dictionary along with sparse representations is strongly NP-hard and also difficult to solve approximately.[25] A popular
heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning isK-SVD.
Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts. In classification, the problem is to determine which classes a
previously unseen datum belongs to. Suppose a dictionary for each class has already been built. Then a new datum is associated with
the class such that it's best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary. Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in
image de-noising. The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise
cannot.[26]

Genetic algorithms
A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search heuristic that mimics the process of natural selection, and uses methods such as mutation and
crossover to generate new genotype in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem. In machine learning, genetic algorithms
found some uses in the 1980s and 1990s.[27][28] Conversely, machine learning techniques have been used to improve the
performance of genetic andevolutionary algorithms.[29]

Rule-based machine learning
Rule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves "rules" to store,
manipulate or apply, knowledge. The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learner is the identification and utilization of a
set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. This is in contrast to other machine learners

that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction.[30] Rule-based
machine learning approaches includelearning classifier systems, association rule learning, and artificial immune systems.

Learning classifier systems
Learning classifier systems (LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component (e.g.
typically a genetic algorithm) with a learning component (performing either supervised learning, reinforcement learning, or
unsupervised learning). They seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a
piecewise manner in order to make predictions.[31]

In 2006, the online movie company Netflix held the first "Netflix Prize" competition to find a program to better predict user
preferences and improve the accuracy on its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10%. A joint team
made up of researchers from AT&T Labs-Research in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built an
ensemble model to win the Grand Prize in 2009 for $1 million.[37] Shortly after the prize was awarded, Netflix realized that viewers'
ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns ("everything is a recommendation") and they changed their
recommendation engine accordingly.[38]
In 2010 The Wall Street Journal wrote about the firm Rebellion Research and their use of Machine Learning to predict the financial
crisis. [39]
In 2012, co-founder of Sun Microsystems Vinod Khosla predicted that 80% of medical doctors jobs would be lost in the next two
[40]
decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software.

In 2014, it has been reported that a machine learning algorithm has been applied in Art History to study fine art paintings, and that it
[41]
may have revealed previously unrecognized influences between artists.

Limitations
Although machine learning has been transformative in some fields, effective machine learning is difficult because finding patterns is
hard and often not enough training data are available; as a result, many machine-learning programs often fail to deliver the expected
value.[42][43][44] Reasons for this are numerous: lack of (suitable) data, lack of access to the data, data bias, privacy problems, badly
[45]
chosen tasks and algorithms, wrong tools and people, lack of resources, and evaluation problems.

Machine learning approaches in particular can suffer from different data biases. A machine learning system trained on your current
customers only may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data. When
trained on man-made data, machine learning is likely to pick up the same constitutional and unconscious biases already present in
society.[46] Language models learned from data have been shown to contain human-like biases.[47][48] Machine learning systems
used for criminal risk assessment have been found to be biased against black people.[49][50] In 2015, Google photos would often tag
black people as gorillas,[51] and in 2018 this still was not well resolved, but Google reportedly was still using the workaround to
remove all gorilla from the training data, and thus was not able to recognize real gorillas at all.[52] Similar issues with recognizing
non-white people have been found in many other systems.[53] In 2016, Microsoft tested a chatbot that learned from Twitter, and it
quickly picked up racist and sexist language.[54] Because of such challenges, the effective use of machine learning may take longer to
be adopted in other domains.[55] In 2018, a self-driving car from Uber failed to detect a pedestrian, who got killed in the accident.[56]
Attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the IBM Watson system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of
investment.[57][58]

Model assessments
Classification machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the Holdout method, which splits the
data in a training and test set (conventionally 2/3 training set and 1/3 test set designation) and evaluates the performance of the
training model on the test set. In comparison, the N-fold-cross-validation method randomly splits the data in k subsets where the k-1
instances of the data are used to train the model while the kth instance is used to test the predictive ability of the training model. In
addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, bootstrap, which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be
used to assess model accuracy.[59]
In addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificitymeaning True Positive Rate (TPR) and True
Negative Rate (TNR) respectively. Similarly, investigators sometimes report the False Positive Rate (FPR) as well as the False
Negative Rate (FNR). However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators. The Total Operating
Characteristic (TOC) is an effective method to express a model's diagnostic ability. TOC shows the numerators and denominators of
the previously mentioned rates, thus TOC provides more information than the commonly used Receiver Operating Characteristic
[60]
(ROC) and ROC's associated Area Under the Curve (AUC).

Ethics
Machine learning poses a host of ethical questions. Systems which are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these
biases upon use (algorithmic bias), thus digitizing cultural prejudices.[61] For example, using job hiring data from a firm with racist
hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants against similarity to previous
successful applicants.[62][63] Responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system thus is a critical
part of machine learning.
Because language contains biases, machines trained on languagecorpora will necessarily also learn bias.[64]
Other forms of ethical challenges, not related to personal biases, are more seen in health care. There are concerns among health care
professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public's interest, but as income generating machines. This is especially
true in the United States where there is a perpetual ethical dilemma of improving health care, but also increasing profits. For example,
the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm's proprietary owners
hold stakes in. There is huge potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals a great tool to diagnose, medicate,
and even plan recovery paths for patients, but this will not happen until the personal biases mentioned previously, and these "greed"
biases are addressed.[65]
